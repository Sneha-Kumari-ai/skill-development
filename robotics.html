        <h2>Introduction to Robotics</h2>
        <p>Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that combines engineering, computer science, and technology to design, construct, and operate robots. These robots can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously, often mimicking human actions to assist in various industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and space exploration.</p>

        <h2>Why Learn Robotics?</h2>
        <p>With the rise of automation and AI, robotics is rapidly transforming how industries operate. Learning robotics not only offers exciting career opportunities but also provides the chance to be part of innovative projects. Key reasons to learn robotics include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Growing demand for robotics engineers and specialists</li>
            <li>Opportunities to work on cutting-edge technology</li>
            <li>Ability to solve real-world problems with automation</li>
            <li>High impact on industries like healthcare, manufacturing, and defense</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Components of Robotics</h2>
        <p>Robotics encompasses various components and systems that work together to create functional robots:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sensors:</strong> Devices that allow robots to sense their environment, such as cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and gyroscopes.</li>
            <li><strong>Actuators:</strong> Components that enable robot movement, such as motors and hydraulic systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Control Systems:</strong> Software and algorithms that dictate how a robot operates and responds to inputs.</li>
            <li><strong>Power Supply:</strong> Batteries or power sources that provide energy to the robot’s components.</li>
            <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> Enables robots to process data, learn, and make decisions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Getting Started with Robotics</h2>
        <p>To start with robotics, it’s beneficial to learn Python for programming and automation tasks. Python libraries such as OpenCV (for computer vision) and ROS (Robot Operating System) provide essential tools for developing and controlling robots. Familiarity with electronics, mechanics, and basic engineering principles will also be helpful in building and programming robots.</p>
