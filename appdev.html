            <li><strong>Web App Development:</strong> Building responsive, mobile-friendly web applications that run in a browser but behave like mobile apps.</li>
            <li><strong>Hybrid App Development:</strong> Combining web and native technologies to create apps that are partially native and partially web-based.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Getting Started with App Development</h2>
        <p>To begin app development, start by choosing a platform (iOS, Android, or both). Install the necessary tools such as Android Studio for Android or Xcode for iOS. Learning programming languages like Swift, Kotlin, or JavaScript (for cross-platform apps) is essential for app development.</p>
