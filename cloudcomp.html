        <h2>Types of Cloud Computing Services</h2>
        <p>Cloud computing is categorized into different types of services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</strong> Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, including servers, storage, and networking. Examples: AWS EC2, Google Cloud Compute Engine.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</strong> Provides a platform for developers to build applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. Examples: Google App Engine, Heroku.</li>
            <li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS):</strong> Delivers software applications over the internet, accessible through a web browser. Examples: Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce.</li>
            <li><strong>Function as a Service (FaaS):</strong> Also known as serverless computing, it allows developers to execute code in response to events without managing servers. Examples: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Getting Started with Cloud Computing</h2>
        <p>To get started with cloud computing, familiarize yourself with cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
